Data Visualization: Make effective data Visualization

# Summary  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosper_Marketplace 
Prosper Marketplace, Inc. is a San Francisco, California-based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry.  
Prosper Funding LLC, one of its subsidiaries, operates Prosper.com, a website where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money.  
The visalization show the evolution of the global amount of money borrowed through prosper loan from 2005 (the creation date of the company) up to 2014.  
In addition, a map has been created in order to see how the amount of money borrowed is distributed in the different states.

# Design  
I made a author driven narrative. The evolution from 2005 up to 2014 is displayed first then, the reader has the possibility to come back to any of years previously displayed.  
I made a line chart on the left hand side of the page in order to get a global view of the evolution through the year.
On the right side I displayed the map, to see how the amount borrowed are distributed in the USA. As it is a Califormian company, it could have been
imagined that the bussines was mainly concentrated on the west cost which not the case.  
Finally, based on the feedback, I updated the initial text in order to better pass my message. In addition, I added a legend on the map in order to explain why some state remain white (no data)

# Feedback  
  Peter:  
  ------  
What do you notice in the visualization?[Peter]  The trend seems to be similar for all states; it doesn’t look like there are one or more states where the amount increases disproportionally to other states  
What questions do you have about the data?[Peter]  It would be nice to be able to hover over the individual states and get the corresponding values. Also why do some states tend to borrow more than others? Is it correlated to population? The states which are left blank, is it because no data is available or were there really no loans in those states?  
What relationships do you notice?[Peter]  The link between the overall amount and the amount of the individual states seems to vary similarly over the years.  
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?[Peter]  Either people didn’t learn from the crisis and we’re headed for another bubble. Or people have confidence that the same crisis would not be possible a second time.  
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?[Peter]  Why is there a drop in 2014?  

  Nayan:  
  ------  
What do you notice in the visualization?[Nayan]  The amount borrowed through Prosper loan increases rapidly between 2009-2013 despite the occurrence of  subprime crisis. This global trend holds true at states level as well. However, there are three states shaded white (= 0 loan??) post 2009.   
What questions do you have about the data?[Nayan]  Same as what Peter raised. Also, from my point of view, the overall title of the visualization should say “total amount of money borrowed and its distribution across states” to set the expectations correct. Also, I would prefer to include the source of data in the plot (not sure if it’s possible to do like a legend or something). The first question I had in mind was where are these numbers coming from , before I start believing them and analyzing them.    
What relationships do you notice?[Nayan]  The distribution of overall money borrowed between states seems to remain similar across years.  The big states like on east and west coast and Texas always get a big share.    
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?[Nayan]  I am not much knowledgeable in finance, but I guess it suggests that the credit business is blooming and investments in such business is encouraged. I am not sure if a comment can be made on people psychology.   
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?[Nayan]  The drop is 2014 for sure and why three states are shaded white constantly after 2009.  

  Renaud:  
  -------  
What do you notice in the visualization?[Renaud] animation of both graphs (global view per year) and map (split per state). Now Strong states = strong money borrowed, no data available for some states.  
What questions do you have about the data?[Renaud] Why some states have no got any data?  
What relationships do you notice?[Renaud] Correlation between the graph (total amount) and the map (amount split per state and visualized with filled circle, its diameter relies on the amount split).   
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?  
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?[Renaud] All is clear
